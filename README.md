# Google Cloud Messaging

Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) is a service that lets developers send data from
servers to users' devices, and receive messages from devices on the same
connection. The service provides a simple, lightweight mechanism that servers
can use to tell mobile applications to contact the server directly to fetch
updated application user data. The GCM service handles all aspects of queueing
of messages and delivery to client applications running on target devices.

This project contains client libraries and samples to help developers interface
with and explore the Google Cloud Messaging APIs.

For more information on GCM, including an overview and integration
instructions, see [Cloud Messaging](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/).

For help getting started with GCM, see the
[GCM Quickstart for Android](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/start)
or the [GCM Quickstart for iOS](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/ios/start).
